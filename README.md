# GuessTheMovie
A Java game where the player gets to guess the movie name given the number of letters in it (pretty much like hangman but with movies)!
The computer randomly picks a movie title from a text file that contains a list of movies, and shows you how many letters it's made up of. Your goal is to try to figure out the movie by guessing one letter at a time. If a letter is indeed in the title the computer will reveal its correct position in the word, if not, you lose a point. If you lose 10 points, game over!
